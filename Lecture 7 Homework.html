        Why do you like cheese.
        <br>
	Cheese is nutritious food made mostly from the milk of cows but also other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, reindeer, camels and yaks.
	<br>
 	Around 4000 years ago people have started to breed animals and process their milk. 
	<br>
 	That's when the cheese was born.
