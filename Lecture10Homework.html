		<h1>The Death Of Hercule Poiret</h1>

	After you have read this, take a train or a car or a series of buses and go to find Elizabeth Cole, who is also Elizabeth
	Litchfield. Let her read this, or tell her what is in it. Tell her that you, too, might have done what her sister Margaret
	did — only for Margaret Litchfield there was no watchful Poirot at hand. Take the nightmare away from her, show
	her that her father was killed, not by his daughter, but by that kind sympathetic family friend, that "honest Iago,"

	amyl nitrite ampoules away from beside my bed. I prefer to leave myself in the hands of the bon Dieu. May his
	punishment, or his mercy, be swift!
	We shall not hunt together again, my friend. Our first hunt was here — and our last ...
