		<p style="color:#EFEFF1; width: 750px;">Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, in Physics, and with her later win, in Chemistry, she became the first person to claim Nobel honors twice. Her efforts with her husband Pierre led to the discovery of polonium and radium, and she championed the development of X-rays.

		<h3>Did you know?</h3>
		<p>After the outbreak of WWI, Curie saw a need to bring scientific advancement to the front lines. The sooner soldiers could be operated on the better their outcomes, but at the time most diagnostic equipment, like X-ray machines, were limited to city hospitals. She developed mobile radiography units by outfitting cars with X-ray equipment and generators, and then enlisted a group of women, including her then 17-year-old daughter, to run them. These mobile units became known as Petites Curies (“Little Curies”). Curie made 20 mobile radiological vehicles and installed 200 more at field hospitals. Over a million wounded soldiers are estimated to have been diagnosed with her X-ray units.</p>

		<p style="color:#EFEFF1; width: 750px;">April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.), German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.

		<h3>Did you know?</h3>
		<p>Albert Einstein was a famous physicist. His research spanned from quantum mechanics to theories about gravity and motion. After publishing some groundbreaking papers, Einstein toured the world and gave speeches about his discoveries. In 1921 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics for his discovery of the photoelectric effect.</p>

		<h3>Did you know?</h3>
		<p>Albert Einstein was raised in a secular Jewish family and had one sister, Maja, who was two years younger than him. In 1903 Einstein married Milena Maric, a Serbian physics student whom he had met at school in Zürich. They had three children: a daughter, named Lieserl, and two sons, named Hans and Eduard. After a period of unrest, Einstein and Maric divorced in 1919. Einstein, during his marriage, had begun an affair with his cousin Elsa Löwenthal. They were married in 1919, the same year he divorced Maric.</p>
