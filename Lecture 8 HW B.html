		<p style="color:#EFEFF1; width: 750px;">Hercule Poirot: the world-renowned, moustachioed Belgian private detective, unsurpassed in his intelligence and understanding of the criminal mind, respected and admired by police forces and heads of state across the globe. Since his inception over 100 years ago, Poirot has stolen the hearts and minds of audiences from Azerbaijan to Vietnam, and his celebrated cases have been recorded across 33 original novels and over 50 short stories.

		<h3>Did you know?</h3>
		<p>In his final case, Poirot decides to kill a hotel guest, Stephen Norton, who has caused the deaths of five people without being convicted, and who plans to kill again. After shooting him, Poirot commits suicide by failing to take the amyl nitrate he needs for his heart condition.</p>

		<h1 style="color:#B5BAF3;">Something More About Poirot </h1>
		<p>Standing at a diminutive 5’4” – although there have been various interpretations of this on stage and screen – Poirot’s described in writing as having an egg-shaped head, often tilted to one side, and eyes that shine green when he’s excited. He dresses very precisely, and takes the utmost pride in his appearance.
		<br>
		Perhaps even more famous than the man himself, is his moustache. Luxurious, magnificent, immense, and dedicatedly groomed, the moustache precedes Poirot into a room; it’s a unique talking point, it’s provocative, and it has a character all of its own.
