		<p style="color:#EFEFF1; width: 750px;">Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, in Physics, and with her later win, in Chemistry, she became the first person to claim Nobel honors twice. Her efforts with her husband Pierre led to the discovery of polonium and radium, and she championed the development of X-rays.

		<h3>Did you know?</h3>
		<p>After the outbreak of WWI, Curie saw a need to bring scientific advancement to the front lines. The sooner soldiers could be operated on the better their outcomes, but at the time most diagnostic equipment, like X-ray machines, were limited to city hospitals. She developed mobile radiography units by outfitting cars with X-ray equipment and generators, and then enlisted a group of women, including her then 17-year-old daughter, to run them. These mobile units became known as Petites Curies (“Little Curies”). Curie made 20 mobile radiological vehicles and installed 200 more at field hospitals. Over a million wounded soldiers are estimated to have been diagnosed with her X-ray units.</p>
